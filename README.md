## Description
When trying to email your representatives in the European Parliament, you end up having to jump from profile to profile to gather email addresses. You then have to combine all intended recipients to send a single email but have it propagate to everyone. 

This application addresses these painpoints by scraping the European Parliament's website to gather information about Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) from all EU countries. The companion webpage provides an easy-to-use interface for selecting your country and the MEPs you wish to contact, and generates the respective `mailto` link to simplify email communications.
